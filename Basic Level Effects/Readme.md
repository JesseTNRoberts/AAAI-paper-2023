## Description

This experiment is a recreation of the Rosch 1975 experiment 7. In it, the subjects were primed at basic, subordinate, and superordinate levels before being asked to classify at those levels respectively. Half of the primings are correct and half are incorrect with each item to be classified being presented once with a correct and once with an incorrect priming. The order of the presentation of the items and the correct/incorrect priming is randomized. They showed that at superordinate and subordinate levels, priming had a greater effect as measure by delay in response time. 

We modify this experiment by using the subordinate level as the item to be classified (Rosch used images to avoid the issue). We also as the model classify without any priming. Then, we calculate the change in probability from the unprimed to the primed correct and from the unprimed to the primed incorrect for populations predicting at the basic and superordinate levels respsectively for each member of the populations. We then compared the results from the two populations.

We refer to the change in probability due to priming as the primed volatility.
