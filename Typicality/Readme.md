## Description

This experiment is a recreation of the experiment from misra and a comparison to the results found when running the experiment in a population. 

We evaluate typicality in relation to the probability and the variance of the population for a given stimulus. 

We evaluate the effect of population dropout by measuring the change in mean probability prediction for a given experiment. If the population dropout changed very little this is emblatic of high population certainty on all stimuli. Further, if this were the case, then for that model conducting psychological experimentation with population dropout would not be significantly more informative than single model experimenation.
